							<p>In genetics, a Punnett Square is an organizational approach to predicting 
								trait inheritance from parent to offspring. For most of the genes in our genome, 
								we have two copies for any one gene; each of these copies is called an allele. 
								You can think of alleles as being variants of a gene that can confer a particular trait. 
							</p>
							<p>Our two alleles can either be the same variant, or they can be different variants, 
								but it’s important understand that these variants are for the same trait. Alleles can 
								either be dominant or recessive, which determines which expression of the trait will 
								be observed. For simple traits – or traits that are determined by a single gene – we 
								can use Punnett Squares to determine the probability of an offspring inheriting a particular trait.
							</p>
							<p>During reproduction, just one of allele from each parent is passed down to an 
								offspring. The Punnett Square demonstrates four possible outcomes of allele inheritance. 
								Then, based on the possible allele compositions, we can infer probabilities for genetic 
								makeup and trait expression.
